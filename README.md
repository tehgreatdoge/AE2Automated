# AE2 Automated
AE2 Cell Partitioner is a Minecraft Mod for Forge that adds a block that
automatically partitions AE2 Cells based on their current contents.
## Usage
Use a hopper or other item transport method to insert a cell (of any type, 
such as fluid, gas, or item) into the 
Cell Partitioner (ae2automated:cell_partitioner). It will be
immediately partitioned. Then, you can extract the cell and it will be
partitioned!
